# CourseProject for ASP.NET Web Forms

## AdsHub

A webforms application for posting and browsing ads. 
Users can search the ads by several criteria and select only the ads in certain category or city. They can also sort them by name, price or places left.

**Unregistered users** can browse the ads and see sellers' profiles.  
**Registered users** can save offers they are interested in and book offers they certainly don't want to miss.  
**Sellers** can create ads.  
**Admins** can see the profile of each user and make them a seller or an admin. They can also create, edit and delete ads.
